This AI Module is trained on different coding wbesites datasets , to generate python codes by the user prompts.
Leaving the GUi functionality and the application/software functionality all the work is done. 

Also this was my First Python project(made in 2023 March) , wasn't updated much on how the cloud storage things works so i wasn't aware of uploading the project to GitHub r somewhere else online , my system got some failures which got me loose this project form me , although managing somehow i recovered it but lost some main files like some of the datasets and tokenizers finctionality , i updateds the code and re-contructed it a bit but making it again not much possible.
So maybe you gonna find some working files missing in it (mainly tha dataset most pronanly) which leads some errors too.

But this whole AI Module properly trained on the old datasets , by Machine Learning proper Algorithm. 
Will Surely try to improve it if possible.
